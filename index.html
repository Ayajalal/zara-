                    Founded by Amancio Ortega in 1975, Zara is a flagship clothing chain store that is part of Inditex group, the world's largest apparel retailer. Amancio Ortega opened the first Zara store in 1975 in central A Coruña, Galicia, Spain where the company is still based. Ortega initially named the store Zorba after the classic 1964 film Zorba the Greek, but after learning there was a bar with the same name two blocks away, the letters were remolded for the sign to say "Zara". It is believed the extra a came from an additional set of letters that had been made for the company.[7][8] The first store featured low-priced lookalike products of popular, higher-end clothing fashions. Ortega opened additional stores throughout Spain. During the 1980s, Ortega changed the design, manufacturing, and distribution process to reduce lead times and react to new trends in a quicker way, which he called "instant fashions". The improvements included the 
                    use of information technology and groups of designers instead of individuals.
